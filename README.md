### Bali Cloud API
This project provides a JavaScript version of the API needed to interact with the [_Bali Cloud Environment™_](https://github.com/craterdog-bali/bali-project-documentation/wiki). It allows a client program to perform the following tasks:
 * manage the client's notary key and public certificate
 * create components and commit them to the cloud repository as notarized documents
 * send and receive notarized messages
 * post notarized events to other interested components
